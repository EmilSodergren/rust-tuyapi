Rust implementation of the Tuya API used to communicate with Tuya/Smart Life devices.

## Acknowledgment
@codetheweb for reverse enginering the protocol.

## Prerequisit
You need to know the key and id of the Tuya device. According to me the easiest way to find these is explained at: [Tuya Code Extract](https://github.com/EmilSodergren/tuya_code_extract)
